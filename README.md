### Hi there, my name is Dennis 👋

🇳🇱 I'm a Data Analyst from Brabant, in the southern part of the Netherlands.

👨‍🎓 I have a background in Data Science and like data puzzles, especially when I can help other people by solving them.

🔭 I'm currently working as a Data Analyst at [Digital Power](https://digital-power.com/en/ "Digital Power's website), where I help other people understanding their data. I can provide insights after doing analyses, or I can train colleagues to empower them to dive into the data themselves!

🌱 I'm currently learning more about Analytics Engineering and dbt. This is the time that I'll finally start filling my contributions list! 

📚 In my free time, I like to read. If you have any suggestions, I'm happy to hear them! Some of my favourites:
